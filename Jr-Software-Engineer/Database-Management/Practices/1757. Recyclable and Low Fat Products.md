## SQL Solution

### Query:
```sql
SELECT product_id 
FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats='Y' AND recyclable='Y';
```

### Explanation:
- **`SELECT product_id`**: Retrieves the unique identifier (`product_id`) of the products.
- **`FROM Products`**: Specifies the table containing product information.
- **`WHERE low_fats='Y' AND recyclable='Y'`**:
  - Filters the rows to include only products that meet both conditions:
    - `low_fats='Y'`: Indicates the product is low-fat.
    - `recyclable='Y'`: Indicates the product is recyclable.

### Example Input Table:
| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | N          |
| 4          | Y        | Y          |

### Example Output:
| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 4          |
